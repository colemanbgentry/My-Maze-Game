# My-Maze-Game
A first project of many for my future as a indie game developer.  
# Overview

A simple top-down maze solving game. With simple ASWD controlls, as you navigate the maze and avoid the many monsters that continue to block your path.

* I want the monsters to collide with the player and the player dying thus ending the game.
* To have more of the levels designed and have a larger map that hopefully will have a few secrets in it for players to find.
* Have monsters behave like monsters.
